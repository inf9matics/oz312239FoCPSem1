Dynamic Variables - Linked Trees and Graphs

1. Dynamic pointers in C++
	- new and delete operator !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (memory leaks)	
	- arrays (operator new type[] and delete []array). 
	
	- construct a regular binary tree of given depth storing random values.
	  Each node must have the fallowing structure:
	  struct node
		{
			int node_id = 0;
			char node_data[100] = {0};
			node *p_left_descendant_node = nullptr;
			node *p_right_descendant_node = nullptr;
		};
	  node_id should contain the following numbers from 1 to the n-th, where n is a number of vertices
	  node_data should contain 100 random printing letters [a-z,A-z,0-9]
	- recursive tree creation, 
	- recursive content printing,
	- random subtree extraction 
	- subtree content printing
	- subtree destroying
	- the rest of the tree destroying.
	- destroyed node should inform the user that it is just destroyed with some message.
2. Implementation of 3 with smart pointers (for advanced students)
