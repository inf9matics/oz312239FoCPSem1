Graphs - shortest path search, Dijkstra's algroithm

Implement a program to find the shortest path in a graph using Dijkstra's algorithm. The graphs are in the files input.txt, input2.txt and input.txt. A first line contains leter U|D where U means undirected graph, and D - directed graph. Next line starts with data type "S:<no>" and "D:<no>" denoting the start node and the destination node, respectively. These data are followed by a description of the graph topology as 3 numbers: the first two are branch nodes and the third is the distance.

For implementation, a structure called a heap is needed. By default, the heap is a self-organizing structure that gives quick access to the largest element. In this algorithm, we need a modified heap giving the minimum value as to the distance. You can use std::priority_queue for this. (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/priority_queue)
