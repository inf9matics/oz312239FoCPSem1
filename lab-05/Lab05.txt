Functions and vectors

Function - Reworking the old tasks
- The function which fills a classical array with pseudorandom numbers (the code can be copied from lab. 4)
- The function that prints the classical array to the screen (the code can be copied from lab. 4).
- The function which sorts an classical array (code taken from lab. 4).
- A function that solves a system of two linear equations (code can be copied from lab. 2); 
	the function returns whether a solution exists, and the values of x1 and x2 are passed by reference.
- The function that solves a linear equation; the function returns whether a solution exists, 
    and the values of x is passed by reference.
    (code can be copied from lab. 2).
- A function solving a quadratic equation (only real solution);
  function should return the number of solutions, and the values of x1 and x2 are passed by reference. 
  (code can be copied from lab. 2).

Vector as an array of non-constant size: vector<T>. Rewrite code from lab. 4 using vector<T> instead of 
  classical arrays.
- Function filling an array with random values (vector<T>).
- Function writing an array to the screen (vector<T>, for (auto a : container) std::cout << a;).
- Function to determine the minimum of an array (vector<T>).
- Function to sort the array (vector<T>).


Functions - New Tasks
- Function to check if a number is prime.
- Sieve of Eratosthenes (to leave only prime numbers in the range 1..N)
- Function to determine the greatest common divider.
- Function to find an integer power of a real number (take care to be correct for a negative power).
- A function that determines a given Fibonacci number (iteratively and recursively).
