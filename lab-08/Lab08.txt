1. 	Write a program that reads text from a file and counts the frequency of each word in the file. 
	The program should then write the result to a file, sorted by frequency. 
	The output file should use the following format:
	```
		<word1> <count1>
		<word2> <count2>
		...
	```
	The program should take two command line arguments: 
		counter <input file> <output file>
2. Counting the frequency of word pairs in the file.
	The output file should use the following format:
	```
		<phrase> <count1>
		<phrase> <count2>
		...
	```
	The program should take two command line arguments: 
		phrase_counter <input file> <output file>
		
3. Generating a text in (pseudo)English randomly based on frequency of word pairs (from task 2).
	The program should take three command line arguments: 
		text_generator <input file> <output file> <number of words to generate>
	The program should generate a text of the specified length (number of words) and write it to the output file.

3. Generating index (list of unique words with line numbers in which they occur) (from task 1).
	The program should take two command line arguments: 
		index_generator <input file> <output file>
	The program should generate a text of the specified length (number of words) and write it to the output file.

A text file e.g. Ulysses by Joyce is included for tests.
